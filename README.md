# Module-5_PyBer_Analysis

## (1) Overview of the ride fare analysis
The purpose of this assignment is to view the total weekly fares for each city type.


## (2) There is a description of the differences in the ride-sharing data for ALL SIX metrics by city type.

*First column* 
- The city type of each city is categorized, which is being used to bucket the cities.  

- Total Rides:
*The total of rides that happened in each city was being calculated by using the ride ID, which is a unique identifier for each ride.*

- Date:
*The date shows when each ride has taken place.*

- Total Fares:
*The total sum of the cost of each ride.*

- Average Fare per Ride:
*Total fare divided by total rides, to show the average cost per ride of each city type.* 

- Average Fare per Driver:
*Total fares divided by the total number of drivers in each city, which the driver count data was being used. This shows the average cost per driver in each city type.*

## (3) Summary
Rural cities have been performing fairly consistently. The beginningfare and ending fare on the line chart is fairly similar. This has been a fewslight increases in the total fare throughout the period, but still within the $500range. Since there were a few slight jumps in the fares, which we would needmore data to understand what cause more rides during that period.   

The suburban fare has shown a significant increase fromabout $700 to close to $1,500, which is a 100% increase. The reaches to close to$1,500 has happened twice throughout the period. We need more data to look intothe two spikes, to understand why these two big jumps happened. Otherwise, thesuburban total fare would be staying around $1,000. 

The urban starting fare and the ending have shown about a 40%increase. However, through the period, we can see there were two times the farehas reached $2,500. Between late February to end of March, the total fareshave been jumping up and down. We should gather additional information to understandwhy is causing the fluctuation.
